# NutriMate

NutriMate is a comprehensive application designed to streamline grocery shopping. This software offers a suite of tools to enhance the user's shopping experience and optimize product selection.

## Key Features

1. **Shopping Checklist**: efficiently create and manage your shopping lists.

2. **Barcode Scanner**: rapidly add products to your list by scanning their barcodes.

3. **Nearby Supermarkets**: identify and navigate to nearby supermarkets.

4. **Product Catalogue**: access an extensive database of products, searchable for easy addition to your list.

## Installation

The NutriMate repository is created and curated by following GitHub best practices. Since a Google Maps API (comprehensive of Places API) is required to make the Nearby Supermarkets feature functional, the following rules must be followed: 
- A .env file must be added to the root folder of the project. This file must contain the variable MAPS_API_KEY. In this section, please provide your API key
- A reference to the .env file must be added (or uncommented, if found) in the asset section of the pubspec.yaml file
- Commented code in the lib/widgets/supermarkets.dart file must be uncommented
- Commented code in the main.dart needed for the .env loading must be uncommented

Project-needed dependencies must be downloaded by running `flutter pub get` (mandatory).

Further actions based on running environment: 

- **Web version:** include your Google Maps API key in the web/index.html file

- **Android version:** include your Google Maps API key in the android/app/scr/main/AndroidManifest.xml file. Run in debug mode by connecting your phone via adb or get the apk by running `flutter build apk`. Finally, install the apk on your chosen Android device.

## Execution

On your machine, for the web version, run `flutter run -d yourbrowser --web-browser-flag "--disable-web-security"`. 

The `--disable-web-security` flag is needed to avoid CORS related errors.

On Android, simply run the installed app.
