# NutriMate

NutriMate is a comprehensive application designed to streamline grocery shopping and product management. This software offers a suite of tools to enhance the user's shopping experience and optimize product selection.

## Key Features

1. **Shopping Checklist**: Efficiently create and manage your shopping lists.

2. **Barcode Scanner**: Rapidly add products to your list by scanning their barcodes.

3. **Nearby Supermarkets**: Identify and navigate to nearby supermarkets.

4. **Product Catalogue**: Access an extensive database of products, searchable for easy addition to your list.

## Installation

The NutriMate repository is created and curated by following GitHub best practices. Since a Google Maps API (comprehensive of Places API) is required to make the Nearby Supermarkets feature functional, the following rules must be followed: 
- A .env file must be added to the root folder of the project. This file must contain the variable MAPS_API_KEY. In this section, please provide your API key.
- A reference to the .env file must be added (or uncommented, if found) in the asset section of the pubspec.yaml file
- Code in the supermarkets.dart file must be uncommented 

## Execution

Web version: include your Google Maps API key in the web/index.html file.

Android version: include your Google Maps API key in the android/app/scr/main/AndroidManifest.xml file. Run in debug mode by connecting your phone via adb or get the apk by running `flutter build apk`.
